At the recent SCAD Festival, the 100 meters heats were closely
monitored.
Each contestant had to run in two races so that the average place
could be determined.
Only one runner finished in the same place in both races.
Alan was never last. Charles always beat Darren. Brian had at
least one first place. Alan finished third in at least one of the
races. Both Darren and Charles had a second place.
In both races, determine the order in which the contestants
finished?
